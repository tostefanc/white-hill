          <p>Before we discuss how leather jackets gained so much popularity and refuse to go away, it is essential to know where our favorite rockabilly outerwear came to be born.

            The ultra-stylish fashion item traces its origin back to military wear. It was in the early 1900s during the First World War that the German fighter pilots began wearing the brown leather jacket – that later, in World War II, came to be known as the bomber jacket (something like in the picture above).
            
            Synonymous with the flight jacket and aviator jacket, the warm bomber jacket was a convenient and sensible choice of outerwear for pilots who had to experience extreme cold at high altitudes. A part of military uniform, the aviators of that time could never have guessed how essential the timelessly chic style would become to the fashion-forward just a few years later.</p>
            <p>In 1928, the leather jacket was first introduced as a fashionable garment by the super talented and an inspiration to many future designers, Irvin Schott. His design (as shown above) was similar to the modern motorcycle leather jacket and was named after his favorite cigar company – The Perfecto.

              True to its name, the jacket design was perfect – and is highly coveted by fashionistas even today. This OG jacket very much inspires the modern street style leather jacket.
              
              Instead of using buttons for the front closure as was the norm for leather jackets of the time, Schott opted for a daring zipper closure, accentuating the entire look of the garment. This first fashionable leather jacket sold for a measly $5.50, probably the cheapest such a highly acclaimed design has ever been priced at in the history of leather jackets.</p>
